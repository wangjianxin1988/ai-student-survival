# /supabase — Database Walkthrough

When the user invokes this skill, guide them through their Supabase database interactively.

## Steps

1. **Show environments**
   Run: `supabase-skill envs`
   Explain which environments are configured (dev/stage/prod) and which refs map to what.

2. **Read the schema index**
   Run: `cat .supabase-schema/index.md`
   Summarize: how many tables, views, functions. Highlight the largest/most connected tables.

3. **Explore a table in detail**
   Ask the user which table they want to explore, or pick the most central one.
   Run: `supabase-skill context <table>`
   Explain columns, foreign keys, related tables, and functions.

4. **Find specific column types**
   Run: `supabase-skill columns --type jsonb`
   Show which tables use JSONB columns (or any type the user is curious about).

5. **Database health**
   Run: `supabase inspect db db-stats`
   Summarize cache hit rates, database size, and health indicators.

6. **Relationship graph**
   Run: `supabase-skill graph`
   Show the mermaid ER diagram. Explain the key relationships.

7. **Open Q&A**
   Say: "Ask me anything about your database schema — I can look up tables, columns, functions, relationships, or run inspections."

## Tips
- Use `supabase-skill search <query>` for free-text search across all schema objects
- Use `supabase-skill table <name>` for deep single-table info
- Use `supabase-skill diff` to check if snapshot is stale
- Use `supabase-skill doctor` for full setup health check
